# P4-WS21-MTCNN
Clone the environment using conda by running: conda env create -f environment.yaml in the base folder containing environment.yml

Run it by calling:
  1. conda activate MTCNN-PNET
  2. python3 test1.py [This is generates patches, which sadly aren't that strong.]
  3. python3 test2.py [This is the latest version, sadly it's not working, since the mistake could not be found                        in time.]
  
For the P-MTCNN attack, the main file to be modified is test.py in the home folder.
