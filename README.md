# P4-WS21-MTCNN
Clone the environment using conda by running: conda env create -f environment.yaml in the base folder containing environment.yml

Run it by calling:
  1. conda activate MTCNN-PNET
  2. python3 test.py [This is the old version, which creates a blurry adversarial patch]
  3. python3 test2.py [This is the version I'm working on right now]
  
For the P-MTCNN attack, the main file to be modified is test.py in the home folder.
